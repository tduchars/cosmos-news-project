## cosmos news - FrontEnd Project by Tony Duchars

## Built on NC News backEnd API

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOCAL HOSTING.
ALSO INCLUDES RECOMMENDED USAGE.
FINALLY CONCLUDES WITH VALUABLE LESSONS TAKEN FROM PROJECT.

## INSTRUCTIONS

To run this file locally you will need to run the command to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## DEPENDENCIES

The package versions needed to locally run the app can be seen below:

```js
"dependencies": {
   "@reach/router": "^1.2.1",
    "animate.css": "^3.7.2",
    "axios": "^0.19.0",
    "react": "^16.11.0",
    "react-animated-css": "^1.2.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.11.0",
    "react-scripts": "3.2.0",
    "react-spinners-kit": "^1.9.0",
    "styled-components": "^4.4.1"
  }
```

(If you have any issues check you are running versions of these
dependencies which will support the functionality.)

## ** RECOMMENDED **

Remembers articles you have read and re-styles the underline to cyan blue once visited an article.

I have also pre-entered a username so just click login or change the username if you wish to an existing username if you like. (find other usernames under the articles)

Once logged in you are given the functionality to add comments and vote on articles.

If you are not "logged in" then this functionality is removed.

Also there is a logout button at the bottom which is only visible if you are logged in.

## WHAT I LEARNT FROM THE PROJECT

I learnt it is very important to structure the layout and concepts of where to hold state in the app formally and to a precise level. Due to me not giving this enough credit I had to compromise various nice functionality.

This is something I had not encountered before but will certainly give more credit to in the future.
